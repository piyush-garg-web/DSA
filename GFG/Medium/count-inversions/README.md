## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers arr[]. You have to find the Inversion Count of the array. 
Note : Inversion count is the number of pairs of elements (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input:
arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]

Output:
3

Explanation:
The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Output:
0

Explanation:
As the sequence is already sorted so there is no inversion count.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
arr[] = [10, 10, 10]

Output:
0

Explanation:
As all the elements of array are same, so there is no inversion count.
```

## Constraints

```text
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104
```
