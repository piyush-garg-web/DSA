# Boundary Tree Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given a root of a Binary Tree, return its boundary traversal in the following order:

Left Boundary: Nodes from the root to the leftmost non-leaf node, preferring the left child over the right and excluding leaves.

Leaf Nodes: All leaf nodes from left to right, covering every leaf in the tree.

Reverse Right Boundary: Nodes from the root to the rightmost non-leaf node, preferring the right child over the left, excluding leaves, and added in reverse order.

Note: The root is included once, leaves are added separately to avoid repetition, and the right boundary follows traversal preference not the path from the rightmost leaf.
