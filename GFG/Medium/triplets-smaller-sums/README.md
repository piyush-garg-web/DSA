Given an array arr[] of distinct integers and a value sum, find the count of triplets (i, j, k), having (i<j<k) with the sum of (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]) smaller than the given value sum.

Examples :

Input: sum = 2, arr[] = [-2, 0, 1, 3]
Output:  2
Explanation: Triplets with sum less than 2 are (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3). 
Input: sum = 12, arr[] = [5, 1, 3, 4, 7]
Output: 4
Explanation: Triplets with sum less than 12 are (1, 3, 4), (5, 1, 3), (1, 3, 7) and (5, 1, 4).
Constraints:
1 ≤ sum ≤ 105
3 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 103
-103 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 103
