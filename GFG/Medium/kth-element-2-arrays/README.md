## Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] and an element k, the task is to find the element that would be at the kth position of the combined sorted array.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input:
a[] = [2, 3, 6, 7, 9], b[] = [1, 4, 8, 10], k = 5

Output:
6

Explanation:
The final combined sorted array would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The 5th element of this array is 6.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
a[] = [1, 4, 8, 10, 12], b[] = [5, 7, 11, 15, 17], k = 6

Output:
10

Explanation:
Combined sorted array is [1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17]. The 6th element of this array is 10.
```

## Constraints

```text
1 ≤ a.size(), b.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ k ≤ a.size() + b.size()
0 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 108
```
