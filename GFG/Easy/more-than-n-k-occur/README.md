## Problem Statement

Given an array arr and an element k. The task is to find the count of elements in the array that appear more than n/k times and n is length of arr.

Examples :

Input: arr = [3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3], k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times.
Input: arr = [2, 3, 3, 2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times. So the count of elements are 2.
Input: arr = [1, 4, 7, 7], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: In the given array, no element appears more than n/k times.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 106
0 <= arr[i] <= 108
1 <= k <= arr.size()
