# Median 2 Sorted Arrays Diff Size

---

## Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[], find and return the median of the combined array after merging them into a single sorted array.

Examples:

Input: a[] = [3, 5, 6, 12, 15], b[] = [3, 4, 6, 10, 10, 12]
Output: 6
Explanation: The merged array is [3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 10, 10, 12, 12, 15]. So the median of the merged array is 6.
Input: a[] = [2, 3, 5, 8], b[] = [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
Output: 11
Explanation: The merged array is [2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]. So the median of the merged array is (10 + 12) / 2 = 11.
Input: a[] = [], b[] = [2, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 4.5
Explanation: The merged array is [2, 4, 5, 6]. So the median of the merged array is (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5.
Constraints: 
1 ≤ a.size(), b.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 109
a.size() + b.size() > 0
