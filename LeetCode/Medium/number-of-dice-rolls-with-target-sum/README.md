# Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum

Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum

---

## Problem Statement

You have n dice, and each dice has k faces numbered from 1 to k.

Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input:
n = 1, k = 6, target = 3

Output:
1

Explanation:
You throw one die with 6 faces.
There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
Example 2:
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
n = 2, k = 6, target = 7

Output:
6

Explanation:
You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.
There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
Example 3:
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
n = 30, k = 30, target = 500

Output:
222616187

Explanation:
The answer must be returned modulo 109 + 7.
```

## Constraints

```text
1 <= n, k <= 30
1 <= target <= 1000
```
