---

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: &ldquo;The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).&rdquo;

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input:
root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

Output:
3

Explanation:
The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
Example 2:
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4

Output:
5

Explanation:
The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
Example 3:
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2

Output:
1
```

## Constraints

```text
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
-109 <= Node.val <= 109
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the tree.
```
